# Predicting car's price

This is my first data science project using Python language and its data scraping, manipulation, visualization and model building libraries. I am using linear regression model to predict car's price based on car's year, mileage, engine power and gearbox type.

Some of the challenges I have encountered when doing this project:
<ol>
  <li>Scraping data: I scraped data of one particular car model's ads quite easily and then I thought I could scrape all ads. But when doing this I noticed a problem: the website that I was scraping shows same ads in several pages. The more ads I wanted to scrape, the more duplicates I got and other ads just got lost. I didn't like the idea of losing data so I had to do with only one car model's ads for now.</li>
  <li>Analyzing and visualizing data: one part is to think what would you like to find out about your data and the other part is trying to shape that data and later make charts of it that would answer those questions. That second part made me really think hard several times.</li>
  <li>Building model: I did build a model but I wasn't happy with the results. I knew the problem: data didn't fit the model. At first, I tried different model but then I realized that I just needed to do some really simple operation on data and after that initial model worked just fine.</li>
</ol>
